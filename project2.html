   I was the Data Analyst in a team of 4 undertaking a data analytics project for Bank of America in which we analysed and displayed data relating to the levels of crime in the boroughs of London compared with the house prices in these areas. My job was to use Python to analyse and display the data in a way in which my team understood so they could create infographics and help present my findings.
